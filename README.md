Concurrency is like having two threads running on a single core CPU. Instructions from each thread could be interleaved, but at any given time, only one of the two threads is actively making progress.

Parallelism is like having two threads running simultaneously on different cores of a multi-core CPU.

It is important to note that parallelism implies concurrency but not the other way round.
